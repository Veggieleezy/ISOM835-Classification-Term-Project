*Objectives- To prepare, clean, process, and analyze a dataset of loan approvals to determine what factors may have strong correlations to a loan being approved rather than rejected.

*Links to Colab notebooks- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B8ZFlVU2Thkrh01uUDvzpyp_AFUL1474?usp=sharing

*Instructions to run analysis- Run each code block one at a time to minimize potential errors.
